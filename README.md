# PYTHON-ASSIGNMENT
It started with curiosity — one “if-else” at a time. Before I knew it, Python turned into more than just code on a screen; it became a way to think, reason, and build solutions.

🔹 Conditionals taught me decision-making — how a program can think in “if this, then that.”
🔹 Loops taught me automation — the art of repeating tasks efficiently.
🔹 Lists introduced me to managing collections of data — adding, sorting, and slicing through information.
🔹 Dictionaries unlocked structured thinking — organizing data with key–value pairs, just like a real-world index or phonebook.

Together, these concepts helped me understand how code flows, iterates, and stores intelligence.

Every output I got right improved my confidence.
Learning Python wasn’t just about syntax — it was about learning logic, clarity, and persistence.
